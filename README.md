# TapRoom

#### Epicodus JavaScript Week 3 Project

#### By Stephanie Mayer && Kate Byars

## Project Purpose
_The purpose of this project was to further learn angular skills and apply them within the realm of our knowledge. This was a two day project while at Epicodus._


## Setup Requirements
* Clone the repo from git hub using:
````
$ git clone https://github.com/smayer0926/Zoo
````
* Open the project in your favorite editor, this was created in Atom.
* Experiment!

_To use this project you will need the following installed properly on your computer._
* You will need to install gulp and bower:
````
$ npm install
$ bower install
````

## User Stories
* As a patron, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I need to see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent (or perhaps something like flavor for a kombucha store).
* As an employee, I want to fill out a form when I tap a new keg to add it to the list. (Don't worry about authenticating employee user accounts yet.)
* As an employee, I want the option to edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake.
* As a patron and/or employee, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. (Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints).
* As an employee, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1.
* As an employee, I want to be able to see kegs with less than 10 pints left so I can be ready to change them.
* As a patron, I want to have kegs prices to be color-coded for easy readability. Perhaps based on their price (greater or less than $5 per pint, perhaps) or the particular style of beer or kombucha.
* As a patron, I want to use the alcohol content property to display stronger beers differently than weaker beers.


## Future Exploration
* _Further exploration would be to add a better UI to the front so that the user has a better experience._
